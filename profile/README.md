## 📦 Core Repositories

Here are the main projects powering DeployPilot:

### 🔧 [deploypilot](https://github.com/deploypilotorg/deploypilot)
Our CLI tool, built with Flask, designed to manage deployment flows across multiple environments. Provides automation and developer-friendly UX for setting up and triggering deployments.

### 🌐 [mcp-server](https://github.com/deploypilotorg/mcp-server)
Handles the backend logic of deployment orchestration, environment state management, and secure execution of deployment jobs.

### 🧩 [mcp-client](https://github.com/deploypilotorg/mcp-client)
A Python client that integrates with `mcp-server`, allowing developers or systems to trigger and monitor deployments programmatically.

### 💡 [example-repo](https://github.com/deploypilotorg/example-repo)
